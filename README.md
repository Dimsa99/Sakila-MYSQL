# Sakila-MYSQL
 My solutions for the Sekila exercises :)
These are my solutions for the Sekila exercises, I really enjoyed them and used my approach to solving these database issues!
After I was finished, i compared my solutions with the internet and saw how many different results there are! I am starting to loving database much more than programming it's very interesting in my opinion :)
